Junta: Coup Simulator 1981

leader (or flunky?) of a recently installed military government - trying to maintain stability in a recently taken over city

maybe a tank / jeep driver?
	perhaps you are actually just doing the coup - need to find and occupy government installations
	kinda like a capture the flag thing
		or tower defense? that's less exciting
	
driving around - trying to get supplies (or soldiers?) from one location to another

shooting protestors with a water cannon lol



concept:
	jeep driver with the military after a coup
	jeep has a water cannon
	trying to maintain political stability by driving around a city

gameplay:
	main metric is STABILITY - game over when this runs out
	drive around city with citizens milling around
	random events occur to be dealt with - arrow on screen pointing to them (when they are off-screen)
	can shoot water cannon at citizens to stagger
		small stability drop if hitting a "normal" citzien
		small stability gain if hitting a protester
	citizens die if you run over them (while driving too fast)
		large stability drop if killing a normal citizen
		small stability drop if killing a protester
		
citizen spawning
	a few citizen spawn points throughout city
	game maintains a target value, periodically spawns citizens when below it
		faster when below 50%

events:
	protest:
		game chooses a random protest point
			ie police station, presidential palace, etc
			some number of citizens in the area turn into protesters
			stability drops gradually while protest is happening
			
			protesters dispersed by hitting them w/ water cannon
			once X% of protesters are dispersed, event ends
	
	item delivery:
		pick up item from a location, drop it off at another
		stability gain on successful delivery
		target time for each phase - stability drops gradually once over that target
