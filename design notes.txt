Junta: Coup Simulator 1981

leader (or flunky?) of a recently installed military government - trying to maintain stability in a recently taken over city

maybe a tank / jeep driver?
	perhaps you are actually just doing the coup - need to find and occupy government installations
	kinda like a capture the flag thing
		or tower defense? that's less exciting
	
driving around - trying to get supplies (or soldiers?) from one location to another

shooting protestors with a water cannon lol
